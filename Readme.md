# Natural Language Processing Specialization on Coursera

- This repo contains the assignment and quiz solutions of all the courses included in Natural Language Processing Specialization offered on Coursera by deeplearning.ai.
- The instructors [Younes Bensouda Mourri](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/ymourri), [Lukasz Kaiser](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lukaszkaiser) and [Eddy Shyu](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/eddy-shyu) have done a great work explaining everything to us.
- I do not promote copying this work, however, there are times when we feel we are stuck and unable to move forward. I hope this repo gets you through those times and you never stop.
- Incase, you don't get something, feel free to ask me anytime. You can find ways to contact me [here](https://github.com/DhruvAwasthi).

 **Note**: I'm currently enrolled in this specialization, and will update solutions as I keep moving through it.

 **Suggestions are always welcome, thank you!**
